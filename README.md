# GeometryLab

A little pet project which is meant to support digital geometry, as is commonly using in surveying, GIS, photogrammetry, among others. Think Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator meets ArcMap. 

The idea is to be a "playground" for digital geometry applications, which can then be upscaled using existing software dedicated to that task. Differently from vector and raster graphics programs, objects have meaningful coordinates and can be constructed through mathematical tools. Differently from GIS programs, objects are more dynamic, and not based on relational database or image datastructures.
